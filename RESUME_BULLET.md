## Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about this project"
> "Code Cartographer is an AI tool I built to solve a problem I noticed as a student - we're great at using tools like Copilot to write code, but terrible at reading existing codebases. 
>
> I built a full-stack application with Python and Flask that uses Google's Gemini API to analyze code projects and answer questions about them. The key innovation is that the AI chatbot is strictly bounded - it ONLY answers questions about the code you've analyzed, so it helps you learn without doing your homework for you.
>
> It includes dependency visualization, real-time analysis updates via WebSocket, and even a VS Code extension. I designed it with academic integrity in mind - it's a learning tool, not a shortcut."

### "What was the biggest technical challenge?"
> "The biggest challenge was making sure the AI chatbot stayed within bounds. I needed to create a system that would build rich context from the analyzed codebase but reject any off-topic questions.
>
> I solved this by building a context builder that extracts only relevant information - functions, imports, dependencies - and crafting a system prompt that strictly enforces boundaries. I also added comprehensive error handling and testing for edge cases like general programming questions or unrelated topics.
>
> The result is a chatbot that's helpful for learning but can't be misused."

### "What would you improve?"
> "I'd add persistent chat history across sessions, code snippet highlighting in responses, and multi-turn conversations with context memory. I'd also optimize the visualization rendering for very large projects and add support for more programming languages beyond Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript."

## LinkedIn Post Template

```
🚀 Excited to share my latest project: Code Cartographer!

As students, we're taught to use AI to WRITE code. But what about READING code?

I built an AI-powered tool that helps students understand existing codebases without just generating solutions. Here's what makes it special:

💬 Project-Scoped Chatbot: Ask questions about YOUR code only (not the weather, not homework answers)
🕸️ Interactive Dependency Graphs: Visualize how files connect
📊 Real-Time Analysis: WebSocket updates as it processes your project
🎓 Educational Focus: Learn to read code, don't just copy-paste

Tech Stack: Python, Flask, Google Gemini API, NetworkX, Plotly, TypeScript

Perfect for students joining open-source projects, learning new frameworks, or understanding class assignments without compromising academic integrity.
